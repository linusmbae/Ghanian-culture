  Akan, ethnolinguistic grouping of peoples of the Guinea Coast who speak Akan languages (of the Kwa branch of the Niger-Congo family).
  <br>
  Most Akan peoples live in Ghana, where they settled in successive waves of migration between the 11th and 18th centuries; <br> others inhabit the eastern part of Côte d’Ivoire and parts of Togo.
  <br><br>
